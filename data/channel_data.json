I do this by creating and sharing educational and inspirational content on social media.The moment we humans fall in love with someone we immediately want to protect them and definitely don't want to harm them. This is why it is important to me that what i show and what I say is not being misinterpret or leads to a wrong way of love for animals and that is ultimately why we created this Video. People need to understand that living with wild animals in a natural wilderness area is not the same as visiting a peting zoo or getting yourself a wild animal as a pet. I dedicated my entire life and beeing in order to live a life amongst them, i risk my life, my time, my everything in order to fit into their world. This commitment and dedication results in the justification of me interacting physically and mentally with these being in a way the world has rarely seen before. This is the reason why i take YOU guys through our content with me into this world in order for You to experience some of this fascination upclose and personal as i do it. Like this You don't  have to quit Your Job, leave Your social enviroment and Your life behind and move into the wilderness for the rest of Your life in order to see them and learn from them upclose and personal like i do it. \n\nShare it with everyone You know and let me know Your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nSUPPORT my MISSION: https://www.deanschneider.com/donation/donate-now/\n\nSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \n \n \nFollow Dean Schneider:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \nTiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.official \n \nOfficial Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ \n\n\n \n\n\n#DeanSchneider #lion",

        "video_description": "It has been a minute since You've heard from me or received an update from the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis. A lot happened over the past months and years and it has been a bumpy road not only for Me but also for some of the Animals. We all knew Leo was after the throne but we also saw the unconditional love between all the lions within the pride. Time showed that a Lion has no other choice then just naturally be a Lion and reach for the highest stars and with that the best possible position in a pride. Even though they are brothers and don't want to kill one another as true Lions they are all prepared to hurt and get hurt for a higher position in the pride.  Such ranking fights can result in major injuries which is the reason we did split them for now and the near future. Being able to move the first lions next months into the Live Wild Area might also change the perspective for their future constellation again. For now they are all happy and healthy with the current constellation. I'm excited to see what the future holds for the Lions, it's definitely going to be an interesting, enlightening and enriching process.\n\nStay tuned for more!\n\nMuch love from the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis to all of You amazing supporters out there.\n\nPS: ''SUPER THANKS'' are mostly appreciated as a support for the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis.\n\n\nVIDEOTITLE\nSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \n \nVIDEO SPECIFIC INFO HERE\n \nFollow Dean Schneider:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \nTiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.official \n \nOfficial Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ \n\nSupport Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donation/donate-now/\n \nAbout Dean Schneider: \nI am a 28-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I\u2019m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet\u2019s wildlife over the past two years!\n\nBorn in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.\n\nEven though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.\n\nAfter starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! \n\nAbout Hakuna Mipaka:\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.\n\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don\u2019t cater to tourists and don\u2019t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don\u2019t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.\n\n#DeanSchneider #lion  #africa",

We don\u2019t cater to tourists and don\u2019t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don\u2019t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.\n\n#DeanSchneider",

        "video_description": "I think the main Message in this Video is to make People understand that whether Monkeys nor any other wild Animals should be kept or seen as pets. I constantly try to communicate this through my Videos because when people see me physically interacting with Animals this can be misinterpreted especially If someone only watches 1 short video-section or sees a picture with me and for example the monkeys but doesn\u2019t dig a bit deeper into my Content & Mission. What Do You think? Does the message that wild animals are not pets comes across well and clear enough or not yet?  I\u2019ll leave the comment Section to you and Your interpretation / opinion of this Topic.\n\nSubscribe:  http://bit.ly/subDeanSchneider | Follow my IG: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \n \n \nFollow Dean Schneider:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \nTiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.official \n \nOfficial Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ \n\nSupport Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donation/donate-now/\n \n\n#DeanSchneider",

I made this Video to give you guys an insight of what it is like to live a life alongside with the King of the Animals!\ud83e\udd81 To me being part of a Lion Pride\ud83d\udc3e is the biggest achievement of my Life. But it is not easy!\ud83d\ude05 It took A LOT of patience, understanding, injuries, ups & downs and all sorts of challenges to master until I was acknowledged, respected & loved as one of their Family\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd81\n\n\nI hope You Guys are enjoying this Video and can learn a bit something about this majestic species and their unique and very inspirational behaviour.\n\nLet Me know what You Think about it in the Comments below and don\u2018t forget to share the YouTube link with all your Friends \ud83e\udd17\u2764\ufe0f\n \nFollow Dean Schneider:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \nTiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.official \n \nOfficial Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ \n\nSupport Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donation/donate-now/\n \nAbout Dean Schneider: \nI am a 27-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world! Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I\u2019m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet\u2019s wildlife over the past two years!\n\nBorn in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.\n\nEven though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.\n\nAfter starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! \n\nAbout Hakuna Mipaka:\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.\n\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don\u2019t cater to tourists and don\u2019t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don\u2019t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.",

Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I\u2019m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet\u2019s wildlife over the past two years!\n\nBorn in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.\n\nEven though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.\n\nAfter starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! \n\nAbout Hakuna Mipaka:\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.\n\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don\u2019t cater to tourists and don\u2019t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don\u2019t breed animals and we are also not trading animals.

Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I\u2019m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet\u2019s wildlife over the past two years!\n\nBorn in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.\n\nEven though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.\n\nAfter starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! \n\nAbout Hakuna Mipaka:\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.\n\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don\u2019t cater to tourists and don\u2019t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don\u2019t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.",

There\u2018s a lot that can go wrong when introducing lions to one another especially after a certain age!\n\nI first had to study each ones character and behaviour very well and then put myself into their skin and try to see the situation out of their perspective! This allowed me to choose the next steps in the process of introduction and make my decisions very carefully.\n\nToday I am very happy and even a little bit proud that everything went so well and the lions have their very own family now.\n\nBut the Challenge is not Mastered yet! As they get older their behaviour will start to change and we hope to be able to keep the Hakuna Mipaka Pride in the constellation it is now.\n\nWish us good luck!\n \nFollow Dean Schneider:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/schneiderdean/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dean.schneider \nTiktok: https://tikitoks.com/@deanschneider.official \n \nOfficial Website: https://www.deanschneider.com/ \n\nSupport Hakuna Mipaka Oasis: https://www.deanschneider.com/donation/donate-now/\n \nAbout Dean Schneider: \nI am a 27-year old Swiss guy, who dedicated his entire life to the animal world!

Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I\u2019m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet\u2019s wildlife over the past two years!\n\nBorn in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.\n\nEven though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.\n\nAfter starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! \n\nAbout Hakuna Mipaka:\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa!

Nowadays, I live in Africa, I am a member of a lion pride, my wife is a hyena and I\u2019m a daddy of two monkeys. Besides that, I have built a global voice for our planet\u2019s wildlife over the past two years!\n\nBorn in Switzerland (Zurich) on October 3, 1992, I was blessed to grow up in a loving family with my sister (one year older) and my parents, who were always very supportive and loving. My mother is originally from the Balkan region (Southeastern Europe), while my dad is a Swiss citizen. I discovered my deep passion for wildlife at the age of six or seven, through the legendary Steve Irwin! He was the one who brought wildlife into my living room in Zurich and inspired and educated me about all kinds of different animal species.\n\nEven though I was so passionate about animals, I originally followed a very ordinary path to adulthood, eventually ending up in the finance industry as a financial advisor. After a very successful year, I decided to found my own company, which then, over the next three years, allowed me to generate the financial foundation to launch the Hakuna Mipaka project at the age of 23-24.\n\nAfter starting my life in South Africa additional financial support form my Family allowed me to evolve and develop the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis for 2 Years without having to depend on any income sources such as offering touristic visits / programs, breeding or trading of animals, donations or any other monetary businesses! \n\nAbout Hakuna Mipaka:\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is located on around 400 hectares (four million square meters) in the wilderness of South Africa! It is home to thousands of different wild animal species! Besides that, the oasis also serves as a life-long home to a few rescued wild animals, which were born in captivity! We also do rehabilitation programs with different animals, which are then being released back into the wild.\n\nThe Hakuna Mipaka Oasis is my personal home and a private sanctuary that is NOT open to the public. We don\u2019t cater to tourists and don\u2019t allow any day visits or animal activities! We don\u2019t breed animals and we are also not trading animals. I built this place for animals and not for humans. The Hakuna Mipaka oasis is a secure, wild & lifelong home to the animals that live here.",
